// TypeScript transpiles the original TypeScript code into plain JavaScript, which is what actually runs in the environment.
// When errors occur or when debugging, the stack traces / breakpoints refer to the compiled JavaScript code, which can be hard to understand.
// Source maps provide a mapping between the compiled JavaScript and the original TypeScript source, enabling debuggers to show the original TypeScript code, making debugging easier and clearer.
